# Delivery System :truck:
This is a project under development aimed at providing a high-quality delivery management system for users (custumers and companies). The system will allow users to track your shipments and deliveries.

### Flows
To facilitate the understanding of the delivery processes in general, as well as cancellation and delivery queries, diagrams have been created that can be accessed through the following link: https://excalidraw.com/#json=4n-lADu8LI4rU5Im_9-D4,KJ3SABZMjN5qu1FvI8DfKg

### Techonologies used
The project is being developed using the following technologies:
- `TypeScript:` a programming language that adds features to JavaScript, making the code more secure and easier to maintain;
- `NestJS:` a TypeScript framework that helps create scalable and easily testable applications;
- `PrismaORM:` an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for relational databases that simplifies communication with the database and makes queries more efficient;
- `MySQL:` a relational database used to store information related to deliveries.

These technologies ensure the development of the project with best practices, guaranteeing code quality and making the system easier to maintain and scale.
